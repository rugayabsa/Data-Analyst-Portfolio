DASHBOARD Sales Performance INSIGHT:

1. Visit Trend

- Daily visits show a steady upward trajectory, increasing from 12 to 40 visits throughout the month.
- This suggests improved sales activity, potentially due to end-of-month pushes, better sales planning, or intensified follow-ups.

2. Deal Trend

- Deals also increase over time, mirroring the visit trend but with small fluctuations mid-month.
- This indicates that higher activity levels directly impact sales outcomes, validating activity-driven sales models.

3. Conversion Rate Analysis

- Conversion rate remains within 8%–25% across the period.
- Several noticeable spikes imply:
  * higher-quality leads
  * successful follow-up patterns
  * or stronger alignment between customer readiness and sales effort.

4. Visits vs Deals Correlation

- The scatter plot reveals a clear positive correlation between visits and deals.
- This confirms that sales activity is a key driver of deal generation and can be a reliable predictor of expected daily performance.

Key Takeaways

- Increased visits → increased deals → more stable conversion rates.
- Significant performance uplift toward the end of the month likely indicates sales cadence or targeted efforts.
- Activity metrics can reliably be used to forecast sales productivity.

Business Recommendations

- Implement a minimum daily visit quota to maintain consistent deal generation.
- Analyze high-conversion days to identify successful sales behaviors and replicate them.
- Improve follow-up strategies during low-performance periods.
- Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard to track visit–deal disparities and guide decision-making.

Dashboard Sales Performance - Sales Activity Deep Dive

1. Distribution Insights

* Visits distribution is slightly right-skewed, indicating the sales team gradually increases activity toward the end of the month.
* Deals distribution also increases over time, confirming a consistent performance pattern aligned with rising visit counts.

2. Conversion Rate Outlier Check

* Boxplot analysis shows no extreme outliers, meaning conversion behavior is relatively stable.
* However, the conversion rate fluctuates between ~5% and 25%, suggesting certain days have significantly better execution quality.

3. Correlation Analysis

* Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.92) between visits and deals, confirming:
  * More outreach directly drives more closed deals.
* Conversion rate has weaker correlation with both metrics, meaning:
  * Productivity (number of visits) matters more than efficiency (conversion %) in this dataset.

4. Key Takeaways

* Sales team performance appears volume-driven, not conversion-driven.
* Improving outreach frequency will directly improve deals
* Additional training may help increase conversion % on low-performing days.

Dashboard Sales Distribution

1. Visit and Deal Distribution

* Daily visits cluster around 20–35, indicating a stable sales activity baseline.
* Deals distribution is right-skewed, meaning high deal days occur but inconsistently.

2. Productivity Trend

* Some days require >10 visits per deal, indicating low efficiency.
* Best-performing days only require 4–6 visits per deal, showing the potential achievable efficiency level.
* Productivity dips often follow high-visit days → possible sales fatigue or low-quality leads.

3. Conversion Rate Distribution

* Median conversion rate stays around 12–15%.
* Outliers show unusually low conversion (<5%) which may indicate:
  * wrong targeting,
  * poor lead quality,
  * inconsistent sales execution.
