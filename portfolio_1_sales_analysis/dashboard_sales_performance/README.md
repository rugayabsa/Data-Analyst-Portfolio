DASHBOARD INSIGHT:

1. Visit Trend

- Daily visits show a steady upward trajectory, increasing from 12 to 40 visits throughout the month.
- This suggests improved sales activity, potentially due to end-of-month pushes, better sales planning, or intensified follow-ups.

2. Deal Trend

- Deals also increase over time, mirroring the visit trend but with small fluctuations mid-month.
- This indicates that higher activity levels directly impact sales outcomes, validating activity-driven sales models.

3. Conversion Rate Analysis

- Conversion rate remains within 8%–25% across the period.
- Several noticeable spikes imply:
  * higher-quality leads
  * successful follow-up patterns
  * or stronger alignment between customer readiness and sales effort.

4. Visits vs Deals Correlation

- The scatter plot reveals a clear positive correlation between visits and deals.
- This confirms that sales activity is a key driver of deal generation and can be a reliable predictor of expected daily performance.

📌 Key Takeaways

- Increased visits → increased deals → more stable conversion rates.
- Significant performance uplift toward the end of the month likely indicates sales cadence or targeted efforts.
- Activity metrics can reliably be used to forecast sales productivity.

💼 Business Recommendations

- Implement a minimum daily visit quota to maintain consistent deal generation.
- Analyze high-conversion days to identify successful sales behaviors and replicate them.
- Improve follow-up strategies during low-performance periods.
