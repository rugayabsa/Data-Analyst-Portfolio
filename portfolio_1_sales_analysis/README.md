Project 1 — Sales Activity Performance & Business Insights

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Google Colab
Dataset: Public Sales Dataset (Superstore / Sample Sales Data)

Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow to support business decision-making. Using a public sales dataset as a proxy for real-world business data, the analysis focuses on understanding sales performance, customer behavior, and potential operational issues through structured data exploration and visualization.

Key Contributions
- Collected, cleaned, and transformed raw sales order data to ensure consistency and analytical readiness.
- Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in revenue, customer segments, and product performance over time.
- Designed and calculated key business metrics, including:
    - Revenue and order trends
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Conversion proxy (visits-to-deals approximation)
    - Top-performing products, customers, and regions
- Conducted anomaly detection to identify:
    - Extreme transaction values (outliers)
    - Unusual sales spikes and drops
    - Data quality issues such as missing or inconsistent records
- Built clear, business-oriented visualizations to communicate insights effectively to non-technical stakeholders.

Key Insights
- Sales performance is highly concentrated, with a small group of customers and products contributing a significant portion of total revenue.
- Revenue and order volume show temporal patterns, indicating opportunities for better forecasting and campaign timing.
- Several anomalous transactions were detected, suggesting the need for routine data validation and monitoring to prevent reporting distortions.

Business Impact & Recommendations
- Focus retention and upsell strategies on high-value customer segments to maximize revenue efficiency.
- Use historical sales patterns to improve demand forecasting and resource planning.
- Implement automated checks for extreme values and missing data to maintain dashboard accuracy and data reliability.

Why This Project Matters

This project reflects real-world data analyst responsibilities: transforming messy data into meaningful insights, building performance metrics, detecting anomalies, and translating analysis into actionable business recommendations. It showcases readiness for remote, freelance, or contract-based data analyst roles where independent problem-solving and clear communication are essential.
